# Question 

Answering the question "Do people in the US get their macronutrient
intake primarily at home or from elsewhere?

# Dataset

[The NHANES 2017-18 Nutrition Dataset](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Dietary&CycleBeginYear=2017)

# Code

The code for this project can be found 
[here](https://github.com/aravind1338/506F20FinalProject)

# Methodology

Using the macronutrient variables for proteins, carbohydrates, 
sugars, fibers and fats, I will find the estimate for average nutrient intake
after splitting the source of the food into "home-cooked" and "outside"

# Results

TODO

# TODO

* The code to calculate the estimates is in code/final_proj.R, I need to actually plot the confidence intervals onto the markdown file

* Need to write up the analysis in detail according to the project specifications
